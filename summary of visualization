I noticed that sales are not the same every month.Some months show a big jump in orders
mostly during the festivals
When I checked regional sales the West region earned the most followed by the South.
These areas seem to have more active buyers.
We should focus more marketing and delivery efforts in these regions.
Even though Furniture doesn’t sell the most, it gives the highest profit. This means it’s a high-margin product.
Some products sell a lot but don’t give much profit – some even cause losses.
This usually happens because of too many discounts or low pricing.
high scale doesn't mean high profit, some times based on it we should gives some discount we will get the high amount of product to be selled!
This project helped me understand how sales, profit, region, and products are all connected.
If we act on these insights, the business can grow smarter, not just bigger.
